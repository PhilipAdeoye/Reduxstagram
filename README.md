 # Reduxstagram 
 
 Based off the [Learn Redux](https://learnredux.com/) course by Wes Bos. Updated for March 2019 and 
 adapted for [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) in order to avoid the 
 messiness and distraction of configuring webpack, babel, etc.

 ## Setup

 - Clone or download zip
 - cd into directory
 - `npm install` to get dependencies
 - `npm start` to run development build on localhost:3000
 - `npm run build` to create production build (just like any React app bootstrapped with create-react-app)
